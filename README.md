# AI-in-AG-conference-Workshop-4-15

In this workshop, participants will focus on fundamental aspects of image classification using the Keras API with a handwritten digit dataset. They will learn key steps including image (matrix) structures, dataset loading and preparation, neural network construction for classification, and model training. Through hands-on exercises, participants will understand the fundamental components of machine learning especially how the neural network trains, laying the foundation for the next workshop which applies convolutional neural network (CNN) for a practical problem: cotton water stress detection. Finally, they will see how to deploy the trained model and interpret the output of image classification problems.
